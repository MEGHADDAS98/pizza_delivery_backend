      summary: Register or Enroll a New Student
      description: |
        Register or enroll a new student in the system. This endpoint should be called when a student is being created or enrolled for the first time, such as during a sign-up or onboarding process.
        It accepts student details (ID, identifier, gender) and an agent identifier (the system or agent performing the registration).
        **Important:** This is *not* a login endpoint; it should only be used for one-time student registration or enrollment events. A valid API key must be provided via the `X-API-Key` header to successfully invoke this operation.
