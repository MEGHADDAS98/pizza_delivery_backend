Yes, exactly! âœ…

Just like you created a `pages` folder, you also create a:

```
src/components/
```

### ðŸ—‚ Folder Purpose Recap:

| Folder Name   | Purpose                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pages/`      | Contains full **screens** or **pages** like `Home.tsx`, `Cart.tsx`                    |
| `components/` | Contains **reusable UI blocks** like `Navbar.tsx`, `CourseCard.tsx`, `CartWidget.tsx` |

### âœ… What to do:

1. Right-click on the `src` folder in VS Code
2. Click **"New Folder"**
3. Name it:

   ```
   components
   ```
4. Inside that `components` folder, create the file:

   ```
   Navbar.tsx
   ```
5. Also create:

   ```
   Navbar.css
   ```

---

Once you've done that and pasted the code from the previous step, your navbar should appear.

Let me know once itâ€™s showing â€” next weâ€™ll add mock course data and display it on the homepage ðŸ”¥
